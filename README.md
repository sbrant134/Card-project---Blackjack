# Card-project---Blackjack
Blackjack for the Lonely:
-	Deal two cards to start the game
-	Type ‘H’ if you would like to take a hit (get another card)
-	Type ‘S’ if you would like to stay – this ends your turn
-	Bust if you have over 21
-	Must have between 18 and 21 to win
-	Aces are low (equal to 1 point)
